# What's BackDrop?

BackDrop's a simple script for a background changing camera filter for online calling.

# How?

This app uses AI to change your webcam's background and makes a fake "virtual" camera through which it redirects this new fake background video stream to.
Which then allows you to use this "virtual" camera as a camera in most apps like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, etc.

# Cool, how do I install it?

You will need either MacOS or Windows to run this.

Currently the app has some prerequisites:
1. Python 3
2. OBS recording software (for the virtual camera)

After installing all that, open your terminal, download the BackDrop code, run the command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then just click webcam.pyw in the BackDrop/src folder to start BackDrop!

# ____ isn't working!

Just go to the Issues tab here in GitHub and write out a issue report with exactly what went wrong and I'll get back to you!

Thanks for checking my little Python script out!
